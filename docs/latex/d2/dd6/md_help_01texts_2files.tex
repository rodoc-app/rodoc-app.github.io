 Each person can have an unlimited number of {\bfseries{files}}, {\bfseries{media}}, and {\bfseries{notes}}. To organize files easily, every {\bfseries{person}} has a separate virtual directory for each file type. When a file is already added to the database, it can be {\bfseries{shared}} among other persons without making {\bfseries{duplicates}}.\hypertarget{md_help_01texts_2files_autotoc_md4}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Virtual Directories}{Virtual Directories}}\label{md_help_01texts_2files_autotoc_md4}
Every virtual directory can be organized individually, just like in every file manager.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{Renaming}} a file or a directory. When renaming a file, it will be renamed for all persons, but the names of directories are not shared
\item {\bfseries{Deleting}} a file or a directory
\item {\bfseries{Creating}} a new directory
\item {\bfseries{Adding}} new files
\end{DoxyItemize}

Keep in mind that all the files need to be in a directory, thus there is always the {\bfseries{root}} directory that cannot be deleted, but it can be renamed.\hypertarget{md_help_01texts_2files_autotoc_md5}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Adding Files}{Adding Files}}\label{md_help_01texts_2files_autotoc_md5}
We have three options for adding files\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Choosing a file that is {\bfseries{already in the database}}
\item Making a {\bfseries{copy}} of an already existing file from a computer
\item Creating a completely {\bfseries{new and empty file}}
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

To keep the project internally consistent and clean, files are {\bfseries{permanently removed}} upon saving the project if it happens that no {\bfseries{person}} has access to them.
